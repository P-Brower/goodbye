<p>We had a good thing going, what the hell?
You hired us and now you're leaving, that's really, really cool of you.</p>
<p>Good luck finding better co-workers than us in "Aberdeen".</p>

<p>Enjoy your Haggis,</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Thank you for helping me build confidence, teaching me about flows, finding solutions with me, laughing with me, and
        being my friend. It‚Äôs been an honor and a privilege to work with you, and I‚Äôm rooting for you always. I hope your move
        to Scotland brings you more peace and new adventures.</p>

            When I met you during my interview, your charisma and energy was incredible and I remember thinking to myself, ‚Äúhe‚Äôd be
            an amazing boss.‚Äù These last two years that you‚Äôve guided and mentored me have been such an incredible experience and I
            appreciate all the effort you‚Äôve put in trusting me and the team. While I initially struggled with my own ability and
            skill set, you‚Äôve helped instill a confidence in me I didn‚Äôt previously have. I hope that Scotland is everything you
            hope it will be and will bring you the peace you‚Äôve been looking for.

        <p>Are you sure you want to do this? You left for a few weeks and now everyone's talking about aliens? Im not saying it's not connected, but its something to think about... </p>
        <p>Its been a very interesting 5 years Danny. Lots of laughs, crying from laughing, just crying, and good memories, I'll miss them. Thanks for seeing something and bringing me in from down the hall, I may not have been the LMS manager of your dreams but I was the LMS manager you got. You've been someone I could turn to for help and guidance whether technical or personal, thank you for that. (I have your number so, buckle up)
        I'm writing this on your last day so I guess I can finally stop worrying about you firing me.

        <p>Working with you has been such an incredible privilege and I am so beyond grateful that our work doesn‚Äôt end here! After
        I interviewed with you but before I was offered the job at Jumpstart, you sent me a link to notes on power query you had
        taken at a conference. I knew in that moment that I wanted you to be my manager and that this would be the perfect
        opportunity for me. Since then, you have helped me grow so much, both personally and professionally, and the confidence
        I have gained as a result is indescribable. Thank you so much for being a great manager, mentor, colleague, and friend!
        I hope Scotland is amazing, and I cannot wait to visit!</p>

            Thank you for breaking things! Jk. I honestly am gonna miss you and being able to have someone to share my mom's food
            with. I remember when you first interviewed me and how it didn't necessarily feel like a job interview but more of just
            a genuine conversation. It won't be the same being in the office and flipping you off every time you walk by my desk and
            make a fart noise. I wish you all the best in Scotland and look forward to seeing photos and hopefully you'll share some
            funny stories! In all seriousness, thank you for helping me and for building things to make my life easier!

        Dear Danny,
        Thank you for not only being a partner in this work, but a true friend. I know you won‚Äôt be far away, physically yes,
        but otherwise no, but I‚Äôll still miss having the work partnership that we‚Äôve built. I‚Äôm proud of you for making this
        decision to take care of yourself and I‚Äôm totally jealous at the same time. I would love to hear about your adventures
        and experiences in another country and you are welcome to drop in on us in Chicago anytime!
        <br>
        Warmly,</p>
